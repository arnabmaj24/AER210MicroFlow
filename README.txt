To run this, you will need OpenCV, Matplotlib and NumPy. If missing run:
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib

To use this, please place all your images in the images folder, pretty simple.
Do all your data processing in measurement.py
Make sure to check all the paramaters, especially for calibration
the script will ask for input. To end the script, click ESC, not the X
at the top right.

You can plot using any of the 3 plotters. Make sure your corresponding CSV 
is in /csvs/ and if you need to remove data form csv, do it manually.
